## Making and indexing data in R

### Vectors

#### Making vectors

```{r}
# make a vector with c()
dogs <- c("teddy", "khora", "waffle", "banjo", "tallie")

#check class of dogs
class(dogs)
typeof(dogs)
```

```{r}
# vectors have to have elements of the same type
breakie <- c("waffles", 2, TRUE, "coffee")

typeof(breakie)
```

```{r}
weights <- c(50, 60, 25, 35, 55)
# these return different options (numeric vs double)
class(weights)
typeof(weights)
```

```{r}
# force them to be integer values

weight_int <- c(50L, 60L, 25L, 35L, 55L)

typeof(weight_int)
class(weight_int)
```

```{r}
# is.(type) asks a question and returns true or false
is.numeric(weight_int)
```

```{r}
# change/recast class
zip_codes <- c(93105, 90064, 92118, 90210, 93117)
# use as. family - gives an instruction (same ones you can is. on you can use as. on)
class(zip_codes)

zip_codes_chr <- as.character(zip_codes)

class(zip_codes_chr)
```

### Create a vector with named elements

```{r}
# add names to values in a vector. doesn't actually add values. Class only corresponds to stored values
dog_food <- c(teddy = "purina", khora = "alpo", waffle = "fancy feast", banjo = "blue diamond", tallie = "farmers dog")

dog_food
```

```{r}
# access ordered elements from a vector. R uses a 1-index, meaning first element of a vector is given position of 1. other coding languages use a 0-index
dog_food[2]

# if an element is named you can also call the name
dog_food["khora"]
```

### Access ranges of values in a vector

#### use : to refer to a range (low:high)

```{r}
# return a range of values
trees <- c("ponderosa", "lodgepole", "jeffrey", "sugar", "bristlecone", "grey")

trees[3:6]
```

### Warm-up for for loops

#### for loops- iterates through values

```{r}
# index
i <- 4

trees[i]
```

```{r}
i <- seq(1:3) # same as writing seq(from = 1, to = 3)

trees[i]
```

```{r}
# vectors are mutable, meaning you can reassign values
trees[3] <- "oak"

trees
```

### Matrix indexing + branch practice

```{r}
fish_size <- matrix(c(.8, .7, .5, .9), ncol = 2, nrow = 2, byrow = FALSE)

fish_size

class(fish_size)
typeof(fish_size)
str(fish_size)

fish_size[2,2]
# look at entire column/row by leaving one blank
fish_size[, 2]
```
